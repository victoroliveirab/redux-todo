This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Roadmap

### Add Redux

After bootstrapping a React App, run `yarn add redux react-redux redux-logger` to add redux to `package.json`.
Note: `npm` can be used in replacement of `yarn`. Yarn is just my preference.

### Create Folders

Inside the `src` folder, create a `components` and `redux` folders. `components` will hold all the components we create for the app, while `redux` will contain the store, the reducer(s) and the actions.
